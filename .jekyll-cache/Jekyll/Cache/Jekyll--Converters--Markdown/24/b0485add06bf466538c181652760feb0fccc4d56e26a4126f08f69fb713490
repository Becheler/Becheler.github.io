<p>Decrypt is a tool allowing to shed light on systems where <strong>cryptic diversity</strong> and
<strong>isolation by distance</strong> are two competing hypothesis. Decrypt can help understanding
if the genetic structure detected under the <em>MultiSpecies Coalescent</em> (<strong>MSC</strong>) could possibly
be explained by an intra-species spatial structure scenario.</p>

<p>It can be seen as a way to automate MSC robustness analyses for different realistic demographic histories
and spatial sampling schemes.</p>

<p>The Decrypt C++ demogenetic simulation core has been developed using the <a href="/pages/quetzal">Quetzal library</a>.
It generates a <strong>spatially explicit demographic history</strong> incorporating environmental
heterogeneity. At sampling time, it simulates gene trees under different sampling schemes.
Then, sequences are simulated along the gene trees, and BPP is run for <strong>species delimitation</strong>.</p>
