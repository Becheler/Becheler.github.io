I"°<p>Welcome to the Quetzal-CoalTL tutorials! :wink:</p>

<p>If you are here, then there is a good chance that you are interested in writing
<em>complicated code</em> to simulate <em>complicated stuff</em> in <em>complicated landscapes</em>
and you would like to understand how this library is <strong>ever</strong> going to
simplify your life :laughing:</p>

<p>Well, the problem with stacking up complications
is that at the end it‚Äôs quite tricky to give you an overview of the library
capabilities and possible extensions without having you running away in utter despair! :cold_sweat:</p>

<p>So I will try to keep things simple. But even doing so, there will be problems
along this bumpy road I‚Äôm trying to carve for us. So don‚Äôt get discouraged if
something happens, and <strong>contact me to help you out</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>:email: write me an email</li>
  <li>:heavy_exclamation_mark: or open an issue on github!</li>
  <li>:point_down: or much easier, just describe you problem in the comment sections!</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="whats-in-it-for-me">What‚Äôs in it for me?</h1>

<p>The big goal of this series of tutorial is to have you be able to use the library
to write your own Quetzal-EGG or to extend the library in the direction of your choice.</p>

<p>But to do so you will have to understand a few concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>:microscope: some are <strong>scientific</strong> in nature
(<em>e.g., how to model gene genealogies in landscapes</em>)</li>
  <li>:computer: some are <strong>pure C++ concepts</strong> (<em>e.g., template programming, policy-based design</em>)</li>
  <li>:snake: other are concepts that are <strong>specific to Quetzal-CoalTL</strong> (<em>e.g., what the library mean by ‚Äúmanipulating gene trees?‚Äù</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, we will begin with simplistic models and expectations, like <strong>simulating a gene copy walking in a straight line</strong>, or <strong>counting the increasing number of leaves in a coalescing tree</strong>.</p>

<p>Not as fun as full blown Quetzal-EGGS, but assuredly more tractable!</p>

<p>But no worries, at the end, we will tie everything together to come up with a customized, usable simulator! :egg: :egg: :egg:</p>
