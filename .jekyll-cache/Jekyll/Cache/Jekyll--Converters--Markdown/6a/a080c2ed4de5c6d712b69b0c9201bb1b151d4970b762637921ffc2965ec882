<p>If the <a href="/pages/quetzal/home">Quetzal Coalescence Template Library</a> is a mother toolbox,
Quetzal-EGGS are her little programmatic children. Quetzal-EGGS is simply a <strong>suit of small simulation programs</strong>
built on the Quetzal library - much easier to understand and use.</p>

<p>Each program is an implementation of an original <strong>spatially explicit coalescence model</strong>.
That is, every Quetzal-EGG will be slightly different than their brothers, varying by
the migration model, environmental reaction norms, or demographic model assumptions.</p>

<p>Each <strong>underlying model</strong> is carefully detailed along with the program documentation
to help the user choosing the right Quetzal-EGG for their <strong>biological question</strong>.</p>
