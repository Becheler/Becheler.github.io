concepts around coalescence models and estimation of their parameters.</li>
  <li><a href="decrypt_spatial">Spatially explicit coalescence models</a>: spatially explicit
models involved in Decrypt rely on a forward time demographic process (reproduction
  and dispersal) followed by a backward coalescence model. This part of the tutorial
  will help you understanding the demographic process.</li>
  <li><a href="decrypt_robustness">Robustness of the MSC model</a>: If it is possible to inform
  the parameters of an explicit demographic model, we can use simulations to test
  the robustness of the MSC and possibly detect levels of diversity detected by the MSC that
  can not be explained by a spatially explicit model.</li>
