<p>The Quetzal <strong>Coal</strong>escence <strong>T</strong>emplate <strong>L</strong>ibrary is a toolbox gathering
<strong>C++ code snippets</strong> that can be <strong>combined</strong> to build coalescence-based, spatially explicit simulators
for inference.</p>

<p>C++ can be intimidating, and we don’t want you to cut your little hands with this bunch of sharp tools and recusant concepts: for more docile and ready-to-use simulators, check our <a href="/quetzal-EGGS/home.md">Quetzal-EGGs</a>!</p>

<p>Still with us? Fantastic! Let’s get into it.</p>
