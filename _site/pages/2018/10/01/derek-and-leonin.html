<h2 id="a-new-blog-about-coding-seriously">A new blog about coding, seriously?</h2>

<p>Definitely!</p>

<p>But here you will not learn <em>just</em> about coding.</p>

<p>If, like me, you come from an academic background like Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,
perhaps you were not taught about <strong>design</strong> and <strong>code principles</strong>.</p>

<p>We learned how to write 200-300 lines of code to analyze data, and most of the time
it is sufficient to our needs.</p>

<p>But not all code projects in science are that short,
and unfortunately principles that work in developing short scripts do not scale with
larger projects.</p>

<p>It raises an important question familiar to software engineers:
<strong>How to not get lost in thousands of lines of code?</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/draw/lost_in_translation.png" alt="lost in translation" /></p>

<p>As methods in Biology become more and more computational, the amount of code
underlying modern research activity becomes actually <em>huge</em>.</p>

<p>Getting familiar with the culture of software engineering is not absurd anymore if
we want our tools to handle the complexity of present and future biological questions.</p>

<p>If you are directly or indirectly confronted with some coding project,
general knowledge about coding principles can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>make your programming activity easier</li>
  <li>better anticipate your computational projects.</li>
  <li>help you understand better the activity of your fellows coders</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software-design-what-on-earth-is-that">Software design? What on earth is that?</h2>

<p>Design is something that can seriously ease your life when it comes to writing thousands of
lines of code for a scientific project, and still conserve structure and clarity.
In other words, it can help you avoid your code turning into a scary network of
interdependent functions: I am of course talking about the well-known
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">spaghetti code syndrome</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/draw/leonin_in_spaghetti_code.png" alt="Leonin in spaghetti code" /></p>

<p>Design was essential for me in building a code base solid enough to be
extended or reused across multiple projects.</p>

<h2 id="is-design-so-important-it-seems-so-abstract">Is design so important? It seems so abstract!</h2>

<h3 id="back-to-the-old-days">Back to the old days</h3>

<p>Well, I lost almost one year of my PhD because I coded a simulation project with
almost zero knowledge of software design.</p>

<p>At some point, the code was just too big, too rigid and too unstable to evolve
further. I was unable to bring the required modification without
breaking everything. Dead end.</p>

<p>I contacted software developers who <strong>helped me understand what the hell was going
on in the code</strong> and helped me finding a better design.</p>

<p>It was unfortunately too late to save the old project (R.I.P. little code!) and I had to
delete <strong>everything</strong> I had previously coded: thousands of code lines.</p>

<p>Back to square one. That was not my best day.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/draw/this_day.png" alt="this day leonin understood the term rigidity" /></p>

<p>I understood the terms <strong>rigidity</strong> and <strong>code dependency</strong> the hard way!</p>

<p>I started all over again, but this time <em>in the right direction</em>!</p>

<p><strong>On an online developers community</strong>, I began to ask each time I was not sure about
the best (the less quick and dirty) way to code a feature or another. Thanks to their
help I was little by little able to acquire some sound knowledge about design.</p>

<p>The code has involved a bit less rapidly, but with much more stability and reliability!</p>

<p>So yes, design is important. Absence of design had in my case rather … concrete consequences!</p>

<h3 id="never-again">Never again!</h3>

<p>At the time of my PhD, it would have been
a dream come true to have access to a resource warning me <strong>I was
missing something crucial</strong>!</p>

<p>I did put huge efforts on training, though.</p>

<p>From books, online tutorials and web pages accessible from my scientific cultural
sphere, I could learn how to use variables, functions, classes…</p>

<p>But at some point in the learning curve I reached the <strong>limit
of the information</strong> that was accessible from my academic culture.</p>

<p>I needed information related to engineering culture to answer my research problem
in ecology, but the cultures are still very partitioned. I am convinced we need
to collaborate.</p>

<p>This is exactly the purpose I want to give to these pages: contribute to bridging
this gap by presenting a number of facts and <strong>design principles</strong> that I should have known three
years ago!</p>

<h2 id="two-hats-one-head">Two hats, one head</h2>

<p>As I expect the average reader to have two hats (researcher/programmer),
I will try to maintain two styles across these pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An intuitive, big-picture(ish) presentation of problems and solutions
for the researcher in Ecology &amp; Evolution.</li>
  <li>A more thorough, technical style illustrated with C++ code for the programmer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here come <strong>Derek</strong> the programmer and <strong>Léonin</strong> the researcher, two charming/grumping characters who will
have much fun in animating the speech.</p>

<p>They use to have different views and priorities making their collaboration somewhat… fascinating.</p>
