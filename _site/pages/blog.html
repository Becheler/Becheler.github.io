      <p>Welcome here!</p>

<h2 id="few-words-about-myself">Few words about myself</h2>

<p>I am a <a href="/">young biologist</a> wanting to share
about a core aspect of my research activity: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design">software design</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://rse.ac.uk/about/why-research-needs-rses/">Software plays an important role in sustaining science</a>,
and code is often written by the biologist himself. Having a deep understanding of
a problem surely helps a lot in coding its solution, but it is not straightfoward
to find <em>how</em> to structure the code.</p>

<p>I have written code for science for a while, mostly in C++, and it took me
years to figure out how much <strong>software engineering culture</strong>
could be beneficial to my coding activity!</p>

<p>So I decided to share some of these ideas by writing a website, and to give a
<strong>gentle introduction</strong> to various software development concepts for the coder biologist.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/pictures/coding_nature.jpg" alt="Programming can be for ecologists too" /></p>

<p>Coding sometimes can be hard and discouraging, so I don’t want this blog to be a
supplementary <em>arid</em> and <em>technical</em> resource.</p>

<p>I want it to be <strong>biologist-oriented</strong>, <strong>instructive</strong>, but also <strong>funny</strong>, <strong>motivational</strong> and somewhat <strong>unconventional</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="derek-and-léonin-the-grumpy-and-the-genuine">Derek and Léonin, the grumpy and the genuine</h2>

<p>I use two characters, Derek and Léonin, to communicate about the cultural gap
existing between Evolutionary Biology and Software Engineering worlds.</p>

<p><strong>Derek</strong> is a research software engineer, quite afraid of the unknown,
caring only about code <em>maintainability</em>, <em>thoroughly tested code</em> and <em>well-defined problems
and solutions</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Léonin</strong> is a curious ecologist, always dreaming about <em>new ideas</em> while wandering
in the wild, willing to explore <em>new questions</em>.</p>

<p>Due to their <strong>cultural differences</strong>, communication bloopers occur,
and they sometimes forget they need to <strong>cooperate</strong> to make good science.</p>

<p>I hope you will <em>have fun discovering new stuffs</em> here, and if you don’t,
feel free to contact me for feedback!</p>
