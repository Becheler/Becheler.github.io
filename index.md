QuetzalCoaTL (COALescence Template Library), or Quetzal for shorter use, is a C++ template library for simulating coalescence processes in spatially explicit landscapes with complex demography.

If you are a scientist interested in studying how populations grow and spread in complex environments using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), this library can offer you some usefull tools for building complex generative models of genetic data.

* Because of ABC is computationally intensive, we wanted Quetzal to be **fast** enough to run millions of simulations in a minimal amount of time.

* Because the set of all possible simulation models is infinite, we wanted Quetzal to be **modular**, so you could feel free to recombine the tools we offer in the way which is most desirable for your own purpose.

* Because you will surely come with your own project bringing many specificities which would be impossible for us to foresee, we wanted Quetzal to be **extensible**, so you can develop your own tools and combine them with minimal cost with Quetzal interfaces.

And because this project is still in development, it is naturally modest and still focused on our specific needs. This is why Quetzal lacks of what could seem to you as basics : please feel free to contact us for feedbacks or collaboration !
