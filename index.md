I am interested in modeling the relationship between environment, demography and
genetics in spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments. This kind of models
would allow to shed light on the ecology of a species (dispersal abilities, growth
capacitiesâ€¦) from observational data, genetic data, and environmental data.

Under such complex models, likelyhood-based inferential methods are useless, and
 _Approximate Bayesian Computation_ (ABC) is a natural way to tackle this
kind of models as it makes use of simulations to estimate parameters. This need for
massive simulations justifies my principal activity of C++ programming.
