I am a French Postdoctoral Fellow at the
[University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/postdoctoral-fellows/arnaud-becheler.html),
mainly working on simulation models for population genetics.

I love to be at the frontier between biology, mathematics, statistics and informatics:
biologists come with a broad question about Nature and some data, mathematicians help to precise
the question, statisticians help to design the tools to obtain an answer from the data, and my role is
to implement all of this in the computer language, so it can compute the answer for us.

I maintain [Quetzal](pages/quetzal.md), a C++ template library easing the development of
population genetics simulators based on gene genealogies.
