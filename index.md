# About me

Some years ago I wanted to work in landscape management : grow trees, design gardens
projects, protect ecosystems and aiming at understanding how all this *mess*
(plants, animals, flowers) can stand in so much chaos without falling apart.

Diregarding some minor details I totally succeeded.

Well, the trees I grow are virtual, projects I design are hardly understood
by professional gardeners, and when I speak about an ever-falling-apart mess
I obviously refer to my dev project.

Oh, wait ... How did this happen ?

Well, planting flowers for years was **great**, really ! But I had this feeling
that remaining in my garden I would poorly understand ecosystems functioning.
So I decided to go to University of Bordeaux, France, to study Biology of organisms.

After one year, I still *hardly* understood a thing about ecosystem complexity.

So I went to University of Salamanca, Spain, to study
more general ecology, learning stuffs about geology, pedology, climatology, botanics... After
six months, I was fluent in Spanish, but I understood *nothing more* about ecosystems.
For the next months, I did a bit of niche modeling, trying to fix all this mess
in a quite coherent setting. Well, I discovered that genetics and evolution were
key aspects in understanding ecosystems. As you can imagine, I knew very little about.

So I went to University of Montpellier, France, to study population genetics.
I quickly recognized I would never ever have a global understanding of all this messy
living things. I learned to focus. I focused on studying by simulation a statistical test able
to detect if a plant population is under natural selection. Soon I became addict
to programing.

Then I went to Paris for a phD, aiming at infering ecological features of an invasive species
from its genetic patterns when the species has colonized a new spatial and heterogeneous landscape.
For having novative results, I novative code.

So I developed QuetzalCoaTL (COALescence Template Library), shortly **Quetzal** , a C++ template library for simulating coalescence processes in spatially explicit landscapes with complex demography.

# Quetzal

If you are a scientist interested in studying how populations grow and spread in complex environments using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), this library can offer you some useful tools for building complex generative models of genetic data.

* Because of ABC is computationally intensive, we wanted Quetzal to be **fast** enough to run millions of simulations in a minimal amount of time.

* Because the set of all possible simulation models is infinite, we wanted Quetzal to be **modular**, so you could feel free to recombine the tools we offer in the way which is most desirable for your own purpose.

* Because you will surely come with your own project bringing many specificities which would be impossible for us to foresee, we wanted Quetzal to be **extensible**, so you can develop your own tools and combine them with minimal cost with Quetzal interfaces.

And because this project is still in development, it is naturally modest and still focused on our specific needs. This is why Quetzal lacks of what could seem to you as basics : please feel free to contact us for feedbacks or collaboration !
