I am a French Postdoctoral Fellow at the
[University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/postdoctoral-fellows/arnaud-becheler.html),
mainly working on simulation models for population genetics and phylogeography.

I love to collaborate with a bunch of people:
- **biologists** who come with some data and a broad question about Nature,
- **mathematicians** who help to precise the question,
- **statisticians** who help to design the tools to obtain an answer from the data.
- **software developers** who know how to efficiently translate all of the former to a computer.

My role is gathering information from these communities so I can implement
the required software.

As an illustration, I maintain [Quetzal](pages/quetzal.md), a C++ template library easing the development of
population genetics simulators based on gene genealogies.
