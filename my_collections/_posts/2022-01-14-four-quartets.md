*"We shall not cease from exploration"* writes T.S. Eliot in his long meditative poem Four Quartets,
that reflects on the place of humankind in the constant flow of time. Like an
invitation to look back in the turbid history of our Earth's turbulent cortege of species,
he continues:

<p class="poetry-line">
We shall not cease from exploration <br>
And the end of all our exploring <br>
Will be to arrive where we started <br>
And know the place for the first time. <br>
</p>

## A poetic regard on the origin of species

The poem seems to murmur to me: *"Where, when did we start?"*. And if we all are related, where did *I* start?

What story can **science**, this never-ending research, this *exploration* of ours,
tell about me, about you, about us?

If language and culture allow the survival of ideas, concepts and values long after
the decay of the body that gave birth to them, when and where will I *end*?

What does it say about those we think as the *others*: the *flying*, the *swimming*, the *swarming*:
when, where, how did *they* start? What places, what landscapes did they visit along their own journey on Earth?

And beyond our ever-present distinctiveness, do we each remember at least a bit of
what we used to be when we were all one and the same *"between two waves of the sea"*?

> Our last universal common ancestor, LUCA, from which all living being descend, is estimated to have lived not so long after our moon was born,
3 to 4.5 billions years ago, in the deep, dark sea near hydrothermal fissures. These hot waters in contact with magma
were rich enough in dissolved minerals to sustain organisms able to use chemical
compounds rather than light as a main source of energy.

Diving further in time, the poem continues,

<p class="poetry-line">
Through the unknown, remembered gate <br>
When the last of earth left to discover <br>
Is that which was the beginning; <br>
At the source of the longest river <br>
The voice of the hidden waterfall <br>
And the children in the apple-tree <br>
Not known, because not looked for <br>
But heard, half-heard, in the stillness <br>
Between two waves of the sea. <br>
</p>

My brain responds to this stanza with a multitude of colorful visions: the forever lost landscapes
of *Vaalbara*, the Archean supercontinent at the beginning of time, the future and limits of science,
the use and abuse of satellite images, the importance of mystery, its *sacredness*.
In our modern world where social medias
show us places we will never visit, have us listen to people we will never meet,
when satellites show us every day every last bit of Earth,
and when our most powerful telescopes let us see so far away, so long ago, **the poem
wonders with me:** is there still out-there at least one secret place left undiscovered?

> A truly remarkable fact is
that we have no concrete fossil, no remaining direct knowledge of LUCA: all that
remains today of its evanescent life are blurred but similar patterns shared in the genome of all living creatures.
Like a silent voice that genetic studies can hear through all living things: a fleeting echo
that still remembers a bit of what it was to be **at the source of the longest river**: Life.

## Primordial words passed down through ages

It is still amazing to me how we can use present information to get a glimpse of
a distant past. Because all the livings are related to LUCA, we do share some similarities.

Some can obvious: most plants are green, while most animals breathe.
Some are tricky: a whale has fins, like a salmon, but are warm blooded and produce milk, like us.

Other similitudes, the most spellbinding to me, are invisible to the naked eye: some resemblance in the
way our cells work, or in the shape of a protein, or vaguely alike molecular words hidden in the
secret of our genetic code.

Since the time our Earth was young, these words have been passed from the first
generation down to the next, and to the next, through billions of years, **to us**, *today*.
They have seen eons, survived cataclysms, have been exposed to untold pressures,
have been rewritten countless times, sometimes with a spelling mistake, nothing much,
barely a letter changed... But accumulate infinitesimal changes for an infinite amount of time time and ...

<p class="poetry-line">
Words strain, <br>
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, <br>
Under the tension, slip, slide, perish, <br>
Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place, <br>
Will not stay still. <br>
</p>

Genetic words are everything *but* still. Like a tumultuous swarm of
young stirlings, they are fluid, chaotic, in constant metamorphosis, always recasted
by random mutations that keep altering their initial meaning, pushing
us away from other species, further away from LUCA.

But not all changes are welcome:
if the genetic alphabet is unable to camouflage the change, if the new word *breaks* the
paramount syntax of its molecular sentence, then it can potentially throw the entire organism into disarray,
in a state of molecular dysfunction, and before long, the new words *perish* with their unfortunate body.
Who can imagine the pressure, the *burden*, the *tension* that nature and fate exert on these delicate patterns?

This slow *decay with imprecision* has been used for decades by geneticists,
who gave it the name of *molecular clock*: a ticking, half-hidden voice that counts
a tale of its own words, and that with its own unit of time tells us, children of LUCA,
how long the road has been since we left our ancestral hydro-thermal shelters.
The primal tale of the *hidden waterfall*, deep beneath the sea.

## Population history, genetic patterns and mutations

using present genetic data has been incredibly useful to understand the past
demographic history of species, allowing researchers to predict more accurately
how species respond to environmental changes.

Indeed, the demographic history of species has left marks in their genes, and that
is how present genetic data can then be linked to past ecological processes.

<p class="poetry-line"> <br>
A people without history <br>
Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern <br>
Of timeless moments. <br>
</p>

## The children in the apple tree

In my research, I study species history by coupling genetic and demographic models that react to spatial and temporal
variations in the landscape the species inhabit.  

The coalescence of two gene copies into a parent copy is simply the replication of
the ADN viewed backward in time. The genealogy of the sampled genes copies can
be defined backward in time conditionally to the demographic process which itself
can be defined before tackling genetical aspects. This is an important theoretical link
between a genetic sample and the historical processes that shaped it, and it can be
used for constructing statistical models allowing to estimate properties of these past
processes on the basis of the present sample.

<p class="poetry-line"> <br>
What we call the beginning is often the end <br>
And to make an end is to make a beginning. <br>
The end is where we start from. <br>
</p>

# Mathematical models

Will we ever know with certitude, *infer with precision*,
what lay beneath the source of our planet's *longest river* : **Life**?

<p class="poetry-line"> <br>
What might have been is an abstraction <br>
Remaining a perpetual possibility <br>
Only in a world of speculation. <br>
What might have been and what has been <br>
Point to one end, which is always present. <br>
</p>

Will we ever be able to reach with certitude a final answer, a definitive narrative
of Earth's boundless biological diversity? If our science allows us to rediscover
what has been lost, to remember what has been forgotten, to remember the long lost places we have
visited and left in our common distant past, will we
find peace and meaning in this *end of all our exploring*?
Or will we feel trapped
and damned by time and causality?
<p class="poetry-line"> <br>
Time present and time past <br>
Are both perhaps present in time future, <br>
And time future contained in time past. <br>
If all time is eternally present <br>
All time is unredeemable. <br>
</p>

## The value of patience

My research is all about trying to understand the past history of natural populations:
where did the populations begin, where did they go, how did they venture through new territories?
How did they overcome the challenges that climate, geology kept throwing at them?

The answers to these questions crystallize so much knowledge: biological intuition,
statistical thinking, hard-core computer simulations details coagulated by some
software design rules...

To build a **strong sense of the past**, I need to design a very *delicate, fragile, beautiful apparatus.*

Sometimes, the apparatus breaks: I look at my mistake, try to understand its nature,
gather the broken pieces of my work, mend them
back into a new abstract construction, with new shapes, that fit together better this time. Maybe. And I do it again. And again. And again. Often I wonder if I'm doing things right, if I'm somehow *good enough* to
deserve to play with these questions. The poem somehow foresees the ruminations
of my impostor syndrome and gently soothes my doubts away with six simple words:
<p class="poetry-line">
Only through time time is conquered.
</p>

Welcoming the words into my mind, I breathe and look by the windows, appeased.
I *am* enough. *You* are enough. We all are, always were, and always will be *enough*.

## Foreword

Poetry, to me, is the art to tell and teach different things to different readers,
or to the same reader at a different time of their life. Poems are not static
statements of eternal and objective knowledge: they are fluid, ever-changing,
always conjuring another word, another memory, with a slightly altered meaning,
never walking twice the same path in the maze of our feelings and emotions.

The metaphoric, associative nature of their words allows them to mirror different questions,
offering different answers to who knows how to ask. In a way, and maybe like a good
friend or a good therapist, they just echo the truth we already know within.
But among the divergent, infinite interpretations of their same text, the poet knows how to
have us look for a unifying truth: the secret meaning of the poem they want us to discover.
