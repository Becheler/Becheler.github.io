You know, when I'm not doodling or messing around, I'm something of a scientist myself... :troll_face:

:seedling: Long time ago I went to a landscaping school to be a gardener. But, as it appeared later,
landscaping was much more about the mechanic of wooden materials or
the exact grocery list of what a lettuce eats in a day than just about planting flowers,
helping seeds grow and making our French landscapes green again.
Plus, I had no idea what to plant that could withstand climate change projections for 2050 anyway.

So, in the middle of an Irish farm field somewhere between Kilkennny and Waterford, looking at a starflower and surrounded by 300 chickens, I decided I was done with practical applications
of agro-ecological concepts, and I went to study the theoretical stuff in Bordeaux, Salamanca, Montpellier, Paris and finally ... ze Michigan!

But the landscape thinking never left me :heart_eyes_cat: Today, spatiality (that is, the effects of space on processes, interactions, organisms and theories) can be found in at every level of my work.
From the most conceptual questions to the statistical methods, and even in some of the most
intricate (and, let's face it, obscure) line of code I write. Let me show you how.

## :earth_africa: Statistical Phylogeography: my discipline

My research is rooted in *phylogeography*, the study of how past processes
have shaped the present spatial distribution of genetic lineages (within and among closely related species).

By *past processes*, I mean historical or geological events, such as:
- artificial dispersal of species (non-indigenous, naturalised or invasive)
- sea level change (impacting species that live in and around islands systems)
- dynamics of glaciers (impacting alpine plants that live on the periphery of these glaciers)
- climate fluctuations (impacting the the [campos rupestres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campos_rupestres), beautiful Brazilian sky-islands)

If you can come with a bunch of models that can generate lineages under some competing scenarios of varying complexity, then you can compare these models to the observed lineages in a statistical framework, and objectively decide what
model is the best supported (that is, what historical scenario has the most likely happened).

</div>

> :hourglass_flowing_sand: These questions are of fundamental importance, and have sometimes a more urging tonality. For example, it is estimated that despite representing only 1% of Brazil's area, campos rupestres shelter around 15% of Brazil's plants diversity, and aound 70% of all species in the Velloziaceae and Eriocaulaceae families! But global warming already pressures these sky-islands, and understanding their past dynamics could help us if or how their species will survive climate change :worried: I don't study these systems (I just find them super cool) but my colleague [Cecilia Fiorini](https://ceciliafiorini.weebly.com/) does!

## :globe_with_meridians: iDDC modeling: my methodology

Fundamentally, iDDC modeling recycles some of the best spatial methods in Ecology and Evolution,
and blends them into an approach that can keep up with the intimidating scales and inferential challenges of these phylogeogaphic questions. The not-so-secret ingredients of the iDDC recipe
are unveiled by its name:

- **Integrated**
- **Distributional**
- **Demographic** and
- **Coalescence** modeling.

This term was coined
### D for ... Environmental Niche Modeling! Wait a minute :thinking:

Yes, Environmental Niche models (ENMs) also go by the sweet name of Species Distribution Models (SDMs).



 Often, it adds a quite case-specific flavor
to every question (even at these scales, a snail is still quite different from an owl,
a fox or a starflower- and acts as such).

In the same way that you don't use a scooter to fly
to the moon, you have to come up with a pretty good engine if you want to look back at the
spatial dynamics of a species over thousands of years. And if this engine does not exist,
well, you can still design the tools to build it.
