# Natural languages and their abstractions.

Programming concepts can seem so arid when you come from the biological world!

Technical aspects of languages are useless if you did not understand *why* the technique has been invented.

To understand better why software design and all the related technical jargon are so important, a pleasant first step is to reframe the question in a *more biological, philosophical perspective*:

> *Which common points do programming languages share with natural languages like English, French, Japanese?*

We will see that our impossibility to constantly remember the most ultimate details of the real world is **mirrored in our natural languages** through the abundance of loosely
defined terms, that allow us to express general ideas.

The purpose of this bunch of pages is to progressively get familiar with the idea that programming languages are **not so different** from natural languages: we **need** abstract words in our code to communicate clear ideas to our pairs.

## Programming activity as a linguistic experience!

> Nouns, verbs and adjectives. Lightness and rigour form the secret of this precious
alloy: the language. Express as precisely as possible, without heaviness, let the
beauty appear. The language is music made of liberty and unbreakable rules - Eve Ricard

As biologists, we use to manipulate very abstract words like *ecosystems*,
*environmental niche* or *natural selection*, but our codes generally **do not reflect** this degree of generality. It can actually be detrimental for the research activity, and I think it is worth to take a moment to wonder why.

In this series of posts, I will develop the idea that we pay way too much attention
to **code details**, when we should actually make our best to **forget them**: in
this sense we should actually try to mimic the way natural languages work.

The urge to follow this principle is not new, and has been termed the information hiding. It's essential, but not very
well understood by our research communities, so I will develop this idea further.

## Benefits of the natural language perspective

Thinking this about programming languages encouraged
me to write more literal, more abstract, more human-friendly code.

This metaphor acted like a **paradigm shift**, switching my mindset about the programming activity from a rather **frustrating observation**:

> "I am writing arid instructions for this stupid machine."

to a **more fulfilling one**:

> "I am explaining to my fellow coder, perhaps even myself in a near future, the problem
at hand and how to solve it. I want the code to be as clear a understandable as the text of a
scientific paper".

I used this metaphor as a constant reminder of our human condition to
inevitably forget details dispersed through the code, were they documented.

Operating this mental shift, I was actually acknowledging my own weakness: oblivion! so I could *adapt using the tools offered by the programming language that exist for this very purpose*.

Doing so, my code became more *structured*, *reusable*, *modular*, *maintainable*.

All the **qualities** we would like to enforce in our science projects!

So naturally I am tempted to share this idea, because I thing it is a useful perspective,
and that is why I write this blog!

##  Why you should definitely read that?

Going through this post series will help you understanding understand better how much **abstraction is important for us**, poor humans (machine actually don't care).

You will perhaps appreciate how the mindset presented here, along with time, patience and the required technical knowledge, can help you to write **better code** and appreciate the true beauty and intelligence of the programming activity!

Perhaps that you will ultimately come to the idea that **programming is not only about a technical description** of your problems in terms of 0 and 1 in such a way it can be understood by a machine.

Perhaps that programming can also be a **new linguistic experience** where a human has to write a text that can be understood *both* by the dumbest machine that can crunch
the numbers *and* by a human intelligence able to understand the purpose.

I hope you will finally see programming languages as wonderful, living, powerful instruments of communication, that open *new ways to think about the real world we aim to describe!*
