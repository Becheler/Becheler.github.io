## October 15th, 2021 - BrazWebinar

*Simulating genetic diversity in heterogeneous landscapes: why, how, limits and perspectives.*

I had the honor to be invited by [Cecilia Fiorini](https://ceciliafiorini.weebly.com/)
for a talk for the [Brazilian Webinars on Bioinformatics](http://bioinfo.icb.ufmg.br/BrazWebinars/home/)!

I had so much fun sharing about this field, and even more answering the audience about:
- Environmental demogenetic simulation models for phylogeography
- Approximated Bayesian Computation
- And the simulation softwares I develop for the field!

Definitely a wonderful experience!

The pdf of the presentation and the R code I wrote to generate ABC basic animations are available!

Many thanks to [Marci Brandenburg](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/marci-brandenburg) from the University of Michigan department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics
for giving me the opportunity to share about my research at the [DCMB Tools and Technology Seminar](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/events/tools-technology-seminar-series)!

I tried a different style this time, and made my presentation highlighting the code more than usual.
It was definitely a fun moment to share remotely!  

The pdf of the presentation is available!
