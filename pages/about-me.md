**Simulating genetic diversity in heterogeneous landscapes: why, how, limits and perspectives**

[![Arnaud Becheler Brazwebinar](https://img.youtube.com/vi/o75wNVkUbHY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o75wNVkUbHY)

I had the honor to be invited by [Cecilia Fiorini](https://ceciliafiorini.weebly.com/)
for a talk for the [Brazilian Webinars on Bioinformatics](http://bioinfo.icb.ufmg.br/BrazWebinars/home/)

I had so much fun sharing about this field, and even more answering the audience about:
- Environmental demogenetic simulation models for phylogeography
- Approximated Bayesian Computation
- And the simulation softwares I develop for the field

Definitely a wonderful experience!

The pdf of the presentation and the R code I wrote to generate ABC basic animations are available.
