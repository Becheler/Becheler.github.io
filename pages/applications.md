# Decrypt

## Summary

Decrypt is a tool allowing to shed light on systems where cryptic diversity and
isolation by distance are two competing hypothesis. Decrypt can help understanding
if the genetic structure detected under the MultiSpecies Coalescent, MSC, could possibly
be explained by the intra-species spatial structure.

It can be seen as a way to automate MSC robustness analyses for different realistic demographic histories
and spatial sampling schemes.

The Decrypt C++ demogenetic simulation core has been developed using the Quetzal library.
It generates a spatially explicit demographic history incorporating environmental
heterogeneity and random population persistence in unsuitable areas.
At sampling time, it simulates gene trees under different sampling schemes.
Then, sequences are simulated along the gene trees, and BPP is run for species delimitation.

## Sampling scheme under Decrypt

In the current version, sampling schemes are quite simplistic. Each scheme is defined
by two clusters of individuals, defining two sampling populations $P_1$ and
$P_2$.
- $P_1$, the red circle in the following picture, is fixed for all simulations at a user-defined location $(lon_1, lat_1)$.
At sampling time, $n_1$ gene copies are sampled uniformly in a radius $r_1$ around this
coordinate.
- $P_2$, white circle, is a population which location varies across simulations: it is uniformly sampled in the distribution
area. At sampling time, $n_2$ gene copies are sampled uniformly in a radius $r_1$.

# Popgen Workshop demonstration

# Go to the proper location

In a terminal, go to the sandbox directory and run the following:
```
cd /home/popgen/software/decrypt/toto/sandbox
ls
```

This directory contains various folders:
- ```sandbox/decrypt``` a folder where the project has been installed along with several examples files
- ```sandbox/play_with_demography``` a demonstration folder for discovering the demographic simulation tool
- ```sandbox/play_with_robustness``` a demonstration folder to visualize pre-computed results

## Example configuration files

The ```sandbox/decrypt``` folder contains:
- a ```spatial_process``` executable for simulating a demographic history and generating gene trees
- an ```example``` directory where you can find:
  - ```australia_precipitation_6032.tif``` a raster representing the rainfall in North Australia
  - ```spatial_process.ctl``` a configuration file for the ```spatial_process``` program
  - ```bpp.ctl``` a configuration file for BPP, not used in this demo
  - ```data_extract``` a bunch of output generated by decrypt that we pre-computed
  - ```last_N.tif``` a raster giving the spatial distribution of population sizes at sampling time when ```data_extract``` was generated
- other things we will not use here

## Running the spatial process

In a terminal, and run the following in the :
```
cd /home/popgen/software/decrypt/toto/sandbox
mkdir output
./decrypt/spatial_process --config decrypt/example/spatial_process.ctl
```

You should see in the terminal if the demographic
history has been simulated, then a not-functional-anymore progress bar,

```

The program outputs as many gene trees in Newick format as they are loci, with each node being represented
by a gene copy ID and the branch length in generations.

As many ```Imap``` files as they are simulations are also printed, mapping each gene copy to a sampling cluster, that is a putative population/species for BPP.

The program generates a bunch of files in the ```output``` directory giving access
to various aspects of the demographic process. We will look to the demographic process more in details
in the second part.

## Demographic process

Run the following:
```
cd /home/popgen/software/decrypt/toto/sandbox/play_with_demography
mkdir output
./../decrypt/spatial_process --config spatial_process.ctl
./visualize.R
```

We are giving this time a different configuration file to spatial_process. Its content is:

```
landscape=../decrypt/example/australia_precipitation_6032.tif
n_sim_gen=5
n_loci=5
lat_0=-20.0
lon_0=125.0
N_0=1000
duration=500
lat_1=-20.0
lon_1=125.0
n_sample_1=30
radius_sample_1=30.0
n_sample_2=30
radius_sample_2=30.0
sampling_threshold=30
suitability_threshold=26.4
K_max=50
p=0.2
K_min_a=15
K_min_b=50
r=1
emigrant_rate=0.5
friction_suitable=0.4
friction_unsuitable=0.6
demography_out=output/N.tif
last_layer_out=output/last_N.tif
distribution_area_out=output/distribution_area.shp
mask_out=output/mask.shp
sample_out=output/sample.shp
database=output/test.db
```

At the bottom of this page, there is an equivalent file with comment documenting the
meaning of the parameters. We are here mostly interested in changing values from
the ```suitability_threshold``` to the ```friction_unsuitable``` options, configuring
the demographic process.

### Demographic model

In its present version, the demographic model considers that the landscape is divided
into *suitable* and *unsuitable* areas. Suitable areas are locations where the value
of the landscape is greater than a threshold. Suitable areas are characterized by
higher carrying capacity $K_{max}$ and a facilitated migration. Unsuitable areas have most of the time a low carrying capacity $K_{min}^a$,
but with probability $p$ a location can switch to a higher $K_{min}^b$. We may surely develop
a simpler alternative model, but in its current state it allows
to simulate interesting patterns of population persistence in unsuitable areas.
The growth rate is assumed constant across the landscape, as well as the emigrant rate.

This configuration allow to generate the following demgraphic history.

Change the value options to generate different types of history. Lower $p$ will be, the more
the demographic expansion will be constrained to suitable areas.

### Inspect the sampling schemes

In the spatial process configuration file, we limited the number of simulations to
5 sampling schemes, each one composed of:
- 1 sampling cluster fixed on a given coordinate
- 1 sampling cluster that varies uniformly across the distribution area

Within a radius of 30km each of these coordinates, 30 individuals are sampled uniformly.
These parameters can be change in the ```spatial_process.ctl``` configuration file.

```
data <- read.csv("data.txt")
mask <- history[[nlayers(history)]]
x0 <- data.frame("lon" = c(125), "lat" = c(-20))
plot_sampling_scheme(mask, x0=x0, r0=30000, x=data[,c('lon','lat')], r=30000, proj4string=crs(mask))
```

The previous lines allow to plot the fixed sampling cluster, in red, and the
5 varying clusters with their respective radius, in black, on top of the spatial
distribution of the population sizes at sampling time, in colors.

### Posterior probability

### In short
To visualize the combined effects of departures from the MSC model hypothesis and
sampling scheme, you can either look at the raw posterior probabilities, or perform
a spatial interpolation of this probability.
```
mask2 <- disaggregate(mask,fact=2)
raw_posterior_probability(data=data, mask=mask2, proj4string=crs(mask))
interpolate_posterior_probability(data=data, mask=mask2, x0=x0, proj4string=crs(mask))
```
![alt text](../demo/decrypt/raw.jpeg "Probability to detect more than one species")

Of course, the example that was developed here focus on a quite recent history, *i.e.*
400 generations, and then test only 5 alternative sampling points. This is
computationally tractable for a demo, but it is not an ideal situation to
perform a spatial interpolation, so we will show the related figure.

###Â Larger dataset

We provide in the ```decrypt/example``` directory two supplementary files giving
the results of a more substantial analysis on longer times with
more intensive sampling scheme:

- ```data_extract.txt```: a larger dataset for proper interpolation
- ```last_N.tif```: The ```spatial_process``` program can also generate this file,
that gives access to the population distribution area at sampling time.

You can run:
```
data <- read.csv("decrypt/example/data_extract.txt",header=TRUE)
mask <- raster("decrypt/example/last_N.tif")

x0 <- data.frame("lon" = c(125), "lat" = c(-20))
plot_sampling_scheme(mask, x0=x0, r0=30000, x=data[,c('lon','lat')], r=30000, proj4string=crs(mask))
mask2 <- disaggregate(mask,fact=2)
raw_posterior_probability(data=data, mask=mask2, proj4string=crs(mask))
interpolate_posterior_probability(data=data, mask=mask2, x0=x0, proj4string=crs(mask))
```

## Adapting the simulation

Besides changing the lanscape tiff file, you can also modify the spatial process parameters
 in the ```decrypt/example/spatial_process.ctl``` file: parameters description is given below.

> **Caution** changing the sampling parameters in the configuration file like the number of loci
or the number of gene copies, requires to also modify the ```bpp.ctl``` file: BPP does not detect
these parameters automatically.  

Also, modification of the spatial model itself (or the sampling scheme) requires modifying
the C++ source code. It should be reasonably easy to do if you know C++. The model specification
is in the [```decrypt/cpp/spatial_simulator.h``` file](https://github.com/Becheler/decrypt/blob/master/cpp/spatial_simulator.h)
 in the code project, checki it out.
