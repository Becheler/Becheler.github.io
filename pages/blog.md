Welcome here!

## Few words about myself

I am a [young biologist](../index.md) wanting to share
about a core aspect of my research activity: [software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design)!

[Software plays an important role in sustaining science](https://rse.ac.uk/about/why-research-needs-rses/),
but code is often written by the biologist himself. Having a deep understanding of the problem to
implement helps to write the code, but does not imply knowing *how* to structure it.

I have written code for science for a while, mostly in C++, and it took me
years to figure out how much **software engineering culture**
could be beneficial to my coding activity!

So I decided to share some of these ideas by writing a website, and to give a
**gentle introduction** to various software development concepts for the coder biologist.

![Programming can be for ecologists too]({{site.url}}/pictures/coding_nature.jpg)

Coding sometimes can be hard and discouraging, so I don't want this blog to be a
supplementary *arid* and *technical* resource.

I want it to be **biologist-oriented**, **instructive**, but also **funny**, **motivational** and somewhat **unconventional**.

## Derek and Léonin, the grumpy and the genuine

I use two characters, Derek and Léonin, to communicate about the cultural gap
existing between Evolutionary Biology and Software Engineering worlds.

**Derek** is a research software engineer, quite afraid of the unknown,
caring only about code *maintainability*, *thoroughly tested code* and *well-defined problems
and solutions*.

**Léonin** is a curious ecologist, always dreaming about *new ideas* while wandering
in the wild, willing to explore *new questions*.

Due to their **cultural differences**, communication bloopers occur,
and they sometimes forget they need to **cooperate** to make good science.

I hope you will *have fun discovering new stuffs* here, and if you don't,
feel free to contact me for feedback!
