# Welcome!

Perhaps were you just looking for the [site roadmap?](#site-roadmap)

## Few words about myself

So as I said, I am a **young biologist** wanting to share some points of view
about what is essential in my research activity: software design!

I write code about science, mostly in C++, but it took me a while to figure out how much
**software engineering concepts and culture** could be beneficial to my coding activity!

So I decided to share some a these ideas by writing a website. The general idea
is to give a **gentle introduction** to various software-related general ideas.

Coding sometimes can be hard and discouraging, so I don't want this blog to be a
supplementary *arid* and *technical* resource.

I want it to be **biology-oriented**, **instructive**, but also **funny**, **motivational** and somewhat **unconventional**.

## Derek and Léonin, the grumpy and the genuine

I use two characters, Derek and Léonin, to communicate about the cultural gap
existing between the Biology and Software Engineering worlds.

**Derek** is a research software engineer, quite afraid of the unknown,
caring only about code *maintainability*, *design*, tests, rigor and *well-defined problems
and solutions*.

**Léonin** is a curious researcher, always dreaming about *new ideas*, and willing
to explore *new questions*.

Due to their **cultural differences**, communication bloopers occur,
and they sometimes forget they need to **cooperate**.

I hope you will *have fun discovering new stuffs* with them here, and if you don't,
feel free to contact me for feedback!
