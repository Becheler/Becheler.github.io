Welcome here random stranger!

## Few words about myself

I am a [young French biologist]({{site.url}}) who wants to share
about a core aspect of my research activity: **software design**!
This blog gives me the opportunity to have some fun learning the basics of Jekyll/CSS/HTML
in a non-professional setting and also (let's face it) to share my silly doodles.

![Derek et Léonin - Seriously?]( {{site.url}}/draw/silly.jpg)

So what's for you in there? Well, [software plays an important role in sustaining science](https://rse.ac.uk/about/why-research-needs-rses/),
and code is often written by the biologist himself. Having a deep understanding of
a grasshopper's life surely helps a lot in coding anything about it, but it can still be a struggle to
to find *how* to structure the code. Hopefully if I do my job properly (what is not a given)
you should learn few things here.

Or maybe I will juste waste your time, in that case please let us know by [filing a complaint]({{site.url}}/draw/public_relations.jpg).

If you are still with us at this point, just know I have written code for science for a while, mostly in C++, and it took me
years to figure out how much **software engineering culture**
could be beneficial to my coding activity!

So I decided to share some of these ideas by writing a website, and to give a
gentle introduction to various software development concepts for the coder biologist.
Coding sometimes can be hard and discouraging, so I don't want this blog to be a
supplementary arid and technical resource. I want it to be **biologist-oriented**,
**instructive**, but also **funny**, **motivational** and somewhat **unconventional**.
Not sure I can make coding *that* fun, but it's worth a try!

## Derek and Léonin, the grumpy and the genuine

I use two characters, Derek and Léonin, to communicate about the cultural gap
existing between Evolutionary Biology and Software Engineering worlds.

**Derek** is a research software engineer, quite afraid of the unknown,
caring only about code *maintainability*, *thoroughly tested code* and *well-defined problems
and solutions*.

**Léonin** is a curious ecologist, always dreaming about *new ideas* while wandering
in the wild, willing to explore *new questions*.

Due to their **cultural differences**, communication bloopers occur,
and they sometimes forget they need to **cooperate** to make good science.

I hope you will *have fun discovering new stuffs* here, and if you don't,
feel free to contact me for feedback!
