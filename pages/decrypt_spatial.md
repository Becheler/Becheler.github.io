In this tutorial you will learn about the principal aspects of spatially explicit
coalescence models. You will first have a look into the forward time demographic
process to understand how to model the fact that geographic distance and environmental
conditions can affect dispersal and reproduction.

# Forward time demographic process

## Reproduction

## Dispersal

## Adapting the model to phylogeographic scales
