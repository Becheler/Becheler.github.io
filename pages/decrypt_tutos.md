## How demography affects the coalescent ?

 - [Coalescence theory starter pack](decrypt_tutos_intuition): some key
   concepts around coalescence models and estimation of their parameters.
 - [Spatially explicit coalescence models](decrypt_spatial): spatially explicit
   models involved in Decrypt rely on a forward time demographic process (reproduction
     and dispersal) followed by a backward coalescence model. This part of the tutorial
     will help you understanding how the two models are coupled.
