Quetzal-CoalTL is a collection of **C++ code snippets** that can be **picked** and **combined** to
build coalescence-based, spatially explicit simulators and inference frameworks.

It has been designed as a **toolbox** allowing a programmer to switch between several
modeling frameworks, and to **rapidly test different models**.
