Quetzal-CRUMBS gathers utility scripts that are transversal to other Quetzal-based projects
([Quetzal-CoalTL](/pages/quetzal/home), [Quetzal-EGGS](/pages/quetzal-eggs/home) or [Decrypt](/pages/decrypt/home)).

This includes:
- sampling parameters for ABC inference
- generating sequences based on coalescence trees
- computing summary statistics
