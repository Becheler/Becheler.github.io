![Quetzal-EGGS](/draw/logos/quetzal_eggs.png)

If the [Quetzal Coalescence Template Library](/pages/quetzal/home) is a mother toolbox,
Quetzal-EGGS are her little programmatic children. Quetzal-EGGS is simply a **suit of small simulation programs**
built on the Quetzal library - much easier to understand and use.

Each program is an implementation of an original **spatially explicit coalescence model**.
That is, every Quetzal-EGG will be slightly different than their brothers, varying by
the migration model, environmental reaction norms, or demographic model assumptions.

Each **underlying model** is carefully detailed along with the program documentation
to help the user choosing the right Quetzal-EGG for their **biological question**.
