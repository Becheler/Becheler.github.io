# Basic Coalescence Simulation Concepts

## Introduction

All coalescence models rely on an underlying demographic process.

We all have a pretty good intuition about real-world  demographic processes: births occur at some rate, with some
mortality during the young stages, then individuals move around, reproduce, and die.

Some demographic models can be quite complex: for example using Quetzal,
the coalescence simulation program can be implemented to account for heterogeneous
landscape, temporal environmental variations or weird dispersal forms.

But in other models, the demographic process can be **so simple** we sometimes forget its existence.

For example let's consider a set of haploid individuals. If they disperse
reasonably fast relatively to the size of the geographic area they occupy, then the
geography will have zero effect on shaping the patterns of genetic diversity.
 In other words we can make the assumption of no spatial structure under some
 biological scenarios: *No space!*

**No space???**

Sincerely speaking as a student I had quite paradoxically much difficulty
understanding anything in non-spatial models of population genetics, because I was
not always capable to link a given simplifying assumption like *panmixia* with
the rather rigid idea I had of what a population in the concrete world should be: a good
population was a *spatially explicit* population, period. It took me time to
understand that dispersal was not always worth to be explicitly represented in a demographic model.

Linking the idea we have of realistic processes to a formal description
that can be simple enough to be practically implemented is not always straightforward,
notably because some processes can be **very important under some conditions but totally
unremarkable under others.**

If you are unfamiliar with coalescent concepts, this tutorial will walk you step by step
through a very simple model to illustrate how some
quantities of interest of coalescent trees vary as a function of the demographic
model parameters, and how some processes shaping the trees can become totally invisible
at some scales.

You will then be able to understand why some model details can be dropped to build a better vision
of the processes that are shaping genetic diversity.

Hopefully, it will allow you to better grasp the why and the how mathematicians derived the
nightmarish - but super useful - variety of formulas haunting the population genetic textbooks.

I hope it will also help you in the future to better decide what model to use for your data.
And also to better understand mathematicians: our communities benefit a lot from mutual understanding.

## The neutral Wright-Fisher model

A central model in population genetics is the Wright-Fisher model, that describes the
evolution of a haploid population through time, by describing how alleles are
transmitted between generations. The model was implicitly defined by Fisher and e
xplicitly defined by Wright.

### Assumptions

This model, defined here for haploid populations, makes a number of assumptions:

- population size is constant in time
- the population described by the model is not spatially structured: panmixia.
- No selection or mutation, i.e. as individuals are equally fitted, their number of
descendants follow the same law.
- Discrete and non-overlapping generations : all individuals reproduce/die at
the same discrete time.

### Demographic process versus genealogical process

Even if we will consider here constant population sizes, the model can be generalized
for variable population size. In that case, these assumptions allow to define
the genealogical process in the following terms: at each
generation $t$, parents die by giving birth to $N(t)$ new individuals that pick their parent
uniformly at random.

Under this model, the demographic process is defined **forward in time**. In other
words, the number of descendants is defined conditionally to the number of parents.

In contrast, the genealogical process is defined **backward in time**: each descendant
picks its parent uniformly at random and independently.

Interestingly, it allows to consider each process separately under the neutral hypothesis:
first the demographic process to determine the number of parents and descendants, and second
the genealogical process to assign each child at each generation to a parent at the
previous generation.

This model allows to track back the ancestry of sampled genes or sequences
in the demographic history of the population. As the more similar genes are expected
to find rapidly their common ancestor, it allows to shed light on
the demographic process underlying the generation of genetic data.

When looking at $n$ sampled genes, some of them may originate from the same
reproduction event in the previous generation, where the parental gene was
replicated into several children genes.

**Forward in time**, it looks like a classical *reproduction event*.
But **backward in time and looking at genes lines**, everything happens as if
some of the sampled lines *merged* into a common ancestor: this is called a *coalescence
event*.

Coalescence events lead the building of coalescence trees, where vertices are
common ancestors of children nodes and where edges are ancestry relationship.

For illustration, we will here work around an extremely basic coalescent simulation program.

### The silliest, slowest discrete-time simulation eveeeer

Let's copy this code in [your favorite R statistical language integrated development environment](https://www.rstudio.com/).

```r
# Haploid population size
N = 10
# Number of sampled gene copies
k = 3
# Upper limit for the plot
tlim = N
# Delay for the animation (in seconds)
delay <- 0.5


freeze <- function(){ Sys.sleep(delay)}
# Sampling time
t= 0

# Plot the haploid individuals of the whole population
pop <- seq(from = 1, to = N, by = 1)
plot(pop, rep(t,N), ylim = c(0,tlim), xlab = "individuals", ylab = "time")

# Simulate in black the sampled gene copies
sample <- sample(x = pop, size = k)
points(sample, rep(t,k), pch=16)

# Loop to coalesce until the MRCA (or to stop when outside the plot)
while(k > 1 && t < tlim){
  t = t + 1
  # Plot the previous population of individuals
  points(pop, rep(t,N))
  freeze()
  # Just to store the parents that have been picked by the lineages
  remember <- c()
  # Iterating over the lineages
  for(child in sort(sample)){ #child = sort(sample)[1]
    # Sample one parent uniformely at random
    parent = sample(x = pop, size = 1)
    # Plot the ancestry relationship between the child and the parent
    segments(x0 = child, y0 = t-1, x1 = parent, y1 = t)
    freeze()
    # Is it a coalescence event ?
    number_of_coalescence = sum(remember == parent)
    if(number_of_coalescence == 0){
      # Nope :(
      points(parent, t, pch=16, col="black")
    }else if (number_of_coalescence == 1){
      # Yes ! :D
      points(parent, t, pch=16, col="blue")
      k = k-1
    }else if (number_of_coalescence >= 2){
      # OMG more than two nodes have coalesced!!!!
      points(parent, t, pch=16, col="red")
      k = k-1
    }
    freeze()
    # Add the parent to the list of already picked parents
    remember<-c(remember,parent)
  }
  # The remaining lineages in the parental generation form the sample of the next iteration.
  sample<-unique(remember)
}
```

Execute the code.

Don't be angry if sometimes the graph gets messy and ugly, the aim was to have the simplest code, not
the prettiest tree!

###Â Simulation exploration

#### Model variability with constant parameters

In this section, we will fix the sampling size to $k = 3$, the population size to $N = 10$,
and the upper limit of the plot to $t_{lim} = N$

> **Question 1: First insights**
>
> Do you observe coalescence events ? How many ?

Try to re-execute the code. Your results will normally change, it's totally expected: the
model is stochastic.

Try to understand each step of the animation and each line of the code.
You can slow down the animation even more if you want by increasing the ```delay```
variable to 1 seconde or more.

- Why are some coalescence events represented by blue points ? Red points ?
- Are multiple coalescence events happening often ?

> **Question 2: Simulating different trees**
>
> Does the simulation output seem to change qualitatively a lot for the same parameters k and N?
>
> What does it mean if you want to simulate coalescence process for various independent loci?
>
> Why does it matter for species delimitation multi-loci methods?

I personally got all gene coalescing in one parent after only two generations:

![triple coalescence]({{site.url}}/pictures/triple_coalescence.png)

and just the next simulation no coalescence at all:
![no coalescence]({{site.url}}/pictures/no_coalescence.png)

Try to explore the variability of the trees that this model can generate by trying to *rematch* these results.

> **Question 3: Some probability**

Let's consider $k=2$ nodes coalescing in a population of size $N$.

> What is the probability they coalesce just one generation before?

> ... 2 generations before?

> ... 3 generations before?

> ... t generations before?

Can you compute the probability of these two simulation outputs?

>**Question 4: Simulating genetic data along the tree**
>
> Among your simulated trees, chose a relatively simple one that has coalesced to the MRCA.
>
>Then chose an ancestral allelic state for this locus like A, T, G or C.
>
> How would you simulate genetic variation in the sampled gene copies along this genealogical tree, from the root to the tips ?

The probability of mutation at each generation is usually very small. And, concretely,
for $N=10$ the height of the simulated tree in number of generation is never very large.

> What does it mean in terms of the probability to simulate at least one mutation event in this example?

>**Question 5: Time to MRCA**

It's rather frustrating to have to stop the coalescence process when we get out of the plot.
*If only* we could set a value for ```tlim``` in such a way we are *almost* sure that
the graph contains the Most Recent Common Ancestor of the sampled lineages.

Under the assumptions of a Wright-Fisher mode, the mean of
the time required to find the Most Recent Common ancestor of the $k$ sampled gene copies
has been shown to be:

$$
E[T_{MRCA}] = 2.N.\frac{k-1}{N}
$$

And the variance is:

$$
V[T_{MRCA}] = N^2.(8.( \sum_{i=2}^{k}{\frac{1}{i^2}}) - 4(1-\frac{1}{k})^2)
$$

> Can these formula help you finding a *good* value for ```tlim```?

> Can you see to these expectations some concrete utility for people coding coalescence simulators?

#### Model behavior for different values of k

Try to set different values for $k$ -reasonably small to not have an ugly plot.

For example $k=3$ and $k=N$.

> **Question 6: Sampling more?**
> How does higher sampling density seem to affect the coalescence process?

Too many branches make the plot look awful. Maybe you could simplify it: disable the
code responsible for plotting the branches and the code lines representing the non-coalescence events.

You will lose the topology of the tree, but you will have a better highlight of the
distribution of coalescence times.

> **Question 7:**
> Look how the coalescence events are distributed along the generations and how $k$ influences them.
> Look also how greater $k$ values influence the probability of ternary coalescence events.

Try to modify the code so it can store the time at which all genes have coalesced to the MRCA.
Perform many repetitions under $k=3$ and for each one store the $T_{MRCA}$.

Plot the distribution and the theoretical expectation of $E(T_{MRCA})$.

Do the same for $k=N$.

Compare these distributions.

#### Model behavior for different values of N

Now disable also the parts of the code responsible for plotting the white circles
representing the population individuals and try to increase $N$ values.

> **Question 8:**
> How do you think that higher population size influences the distributions of coalescence events?

Now, can you add some lines of code so you can remember all coalescence times and plot their distribution?
Think about the link between this distribution and what it means in terms of genetic
data that can be simulated.

Can you imagine which other statistical property of the coalescent tree that would be of interest?

#### The computational cost of "nothing is happening in my simulation"
Try very high values like $N = 10000$, $k=100$.

Can you feel the computational cost increasing?

Have a look at how many generations occur without a single coalescence event simulated when
the population size is very high.

> **Question 9:**
> What do you think it means in terms of genetic diversity that can be simulated on this tree?

> **Question 10:**
> Do yo think that simulating each generation one by one is the most relevant approach for large Wright-Fisher populations?

## The n-coalescent: just another way to look at the same process.

### A more efficient approach than simulating generation-by-generation.

For large Wright-Fisher populations, we saw that many generations can go without
any coalescence event happening. Simulating each generation is then not always the best
approach, both computationally and theoretically: we are losing computational time
and we are also losing sight of the general behavior of the coalescent tree model.

There is better to do.

A mathematician can show you that when $k$ lineages coalesce in a Wright-Fisher population of size $N$, it is possible
to mathematically derive interesting properties of the process like for example $T_1$, the first time of coalescence.

Of course we can not *compute* with certainty $T_1$, since the coalescence process
is stochastic. But starting from the smallest details of the Wright-Fisher model, it is possible to
progressively figure out how this tiny stochastic events affect the **distribution** of
the $T_1$ values. That is we are able to quantify the properties of the uncertainty
surrounding $T_1$.

We will not go on further mathematical details here, but just know that when coalescing $k$ lineages
in $N$ parents, the waiting time for the next coalescence event is distributed geometrically
with mean:

$$
m = \frac{N}{k\choose 2}
$$

and parameter $p = 1/(1 + m)$

This probability distribution was exactly what we need to simulate the coalescence process more efficiently:
- sample a waiting time for $k$ and $N$
- then chose two lineages uniformely at random
- coalesce them, go to first step for $k-1$ and $N$.

### Simulation

Can you end up with a version of this simulation model?
