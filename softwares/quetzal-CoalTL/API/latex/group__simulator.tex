\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Template classes for simulating discrete-\/time coalescence processes. 

Template classes to simulate coalescence in complex frameworks.

These classes are useful for defining stochastic processes that enable coalescence simulation of a sample.\hypertarget{group__simulator_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsubsection{C++ concept \+: Generative\+Model}\label{group__simulator_autotoc_md12}
The abc module relies heavily on the C++ concept of Generative\+Model, which defines the set of constraints that a simulation model object must have to interact with the abc module.

The type {\ttfamily D} satisfies Generative\+Model if


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily D} satisfies \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/CopyConstructible}{\texttt{ Copy\+Constructible}}
\item {\ttfamily D} satisfies \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/CopyAssignable}{\texttt{ Copy\+Assignable}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Given


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily T}, the type named by {\ttfamily M\+::return\+\_\+type}
\item {\ttfamily P}, the type named by {\ttfamily M\+::param\+\_\+type}, which\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item satisfies \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/CopyConstructible}{\texttt{ Copy\+Constructible}}
\item satisfies \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/CopyAssignable}{\texttt{ Copy\+Assignable}}
\item satisfies \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/EqualityComparable}{\texttt{ Equality\+Comparable}}
\item has a constructor taking identical arguments as each of the constructors of {\ttfamily D} that take arguments corresponding to the model parameters.
\item has a member function with the identical name, type, and semantics, as every member function of {\ttfamily D} that returns a parameter of the model
\item declares a member typedef {\ttfamily using distribution\+\_\+type = D};
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily d}, a value of type {\ttfamily D}
\item {\ttfamily x}, a (possibly {\ttfamily const}) value of type {\ttfamily D}
\item {\ttfamily p}, a (possibly {\ttfamily const}) value of type {\ttfamily P}
\item {\ttfamily g}, a lvalue of a type satisfying the S\+TL \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/UniformRandomBitGenerator}{\texttt{ Uniform\+Random\+Bit\+Generator}} concept
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
All types satisfying the requirements of the S\+TL \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/RandomNumberDistribution}{\texttt{ Random\+Number\+Distribution}} satisfy quetzal Generative\+Model concept.
