The Quetzal **Coal**escence **T**emplate **L**ibrary is a toolbox gathering
**C++ code snippets** that can be **combined** to build coalescence-based, spatially explicit simulators
for inference.

C++ can be intimidating, and we don't want you to cut you hands with this bunch of sharp tools and recusant concepts: for more docile and ready-to-use simulators, check our [Quetzal-EGGs](/quetzal-EGGS/home.md)!

Still with us? Fantastic! Let's get into it.

## Tutorials


### Forward-in-time demographic simulations

[How to use different strategies for simulating populations dispersal:](/tutorials/demography.md)

- Individual-based dispersal in small populations
- Mass-based dispersal for large populations

[How to integrate landscape heterogeneity in the analysis with GIS:](/tutorials/geography.md)

- For retrieving a demic structure
- For constructing multivariate, spatially explicit, temporally changing landscapes.

[How to construct niche functions](/tutorials/niche.md)
- Enable mathematical composition of functions of space and time using expressive
- Coupling environment, growth model and stochastic sampling.

 How to represent dispersal models:

  - using library-defined distance-based dispersal models
  - implementing user-defined dispersal models

### Backward-in-time coalescence simulation

How to think about coalescence graphs:

- using user-defined data structure (that is, the graph nodes)
- using user-defined ancestral relationship (that is, the graph edge)

How to coalesce forests in a spatially explicit framework

- using the Kingman coalescent approximation (binary merges)
- using the multiple merger for small populations
