-------------------------

The Quetzal **Coal**escence **T**emplate **L**ibrary is a toolbox gathering
**C++ code snippets** that can be **combined** to build coalescence-based, spatially explicit simulators
for inference.

C++ can be intimidating, and we don't want you to cut your little hands with this bunch of sharp tools and recusant concepts: for more docile and ready-to-use simulators, check our [Quetzal-EGGs](/quetzal-EGGS/home.md)!

Still with us? Fantastic! Let's get into it.
