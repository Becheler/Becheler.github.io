-------------------------

The Quetzal **Coal**escence **T**emplate **L**ibrary is a toolbox gathering
**C++ code snippets** that can be **combined** to build coalescence-based, spatially explicit simulators
for inference.

C++ can be intimidating, and we don't want you to cut your little hands with this bunch of sharp tools and recusant concepts: for more docile and ready-to-use simulators, check our [Quetzal-EGGs](/quetzal-EGGS/home.md)! :egg: :egg: :egg:

Still with us? Fantastic! Let's get into it! :raised_hands:

-------------------------

### What you can find here :point_up:

- Some tutorials to begin coding with Quetzal-CoalTL :woman_teacher:

- The C++ API documentation to get more detailed knowledge of the code :books:

- A FAQ to answer questions, or as new ones! :question:

----------------------------

### Disclaimer :bug:

I use Github actions to automatically update the documentation as well as test and refresh the tutorials code:
- everyday at midnight :owl:
- or after every new version on the library repo :tada:

If everything goes as planed (what never does :scream_cat:), you should be able to easily go through the tutorials.

However, bugs have this very bad habit to swarm in overlooked areas: so if you see one, just let me know! :bug:
